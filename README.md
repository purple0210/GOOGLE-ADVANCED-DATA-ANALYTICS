## 📌 Projects Overview

### 1. TikTok Machine Learning Project

**Objective:**
Build a machine learning model to classify whether a TikTok video contains a **claim** or expresses an **opinion**, helping TikTok reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize moderation workflows more efficiently.

**Key Highlights:**

* Framed the problem as a supervised classification task
* Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and train/test splitting
* Evaluated multiple models including:

  * Random Forest
  * XGBoost
* Achieved near-perfect performance with both models
* Selected **Random Forest** as the *champion model* based on slightly superior evaluation metrics
* Used the champion model to generate predictions on test data

**Impact:**
Enables scalable content moderation and more efficient prioritization of user reports.

### 2. Capstone Project – Salifort Motors Employee Retention Analysis

**Objective:**
Analyze employee data to understand attrition patterns and provide data-driven recommendations to improve retention and reduce recruitment costs.

**Dataset:**

* 14,999 employee records
* 10 features
* 10 departments

**Key Findings:**

* Identified that **45.5% of employees leave the company at around 5 years of tenure**
* Discovered workload and project count as strong indicators of attrition

**Modeling & Results:**

* Compared multiple machine learning models
* Selected **XGBoost** as the final model
* Achieved:

  * **96.3% accuracy**
  * **88.9% F1-score**

**Business Recommendations:**

* Assign **3–4 projects per employee** to balance productivity and burnout
* Use predictive insights to proactively address retention risks

**Impact:**
Improved HR decision-making and supported cost reduction strategies for Salifort Motors.
